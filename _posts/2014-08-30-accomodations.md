We recommend that our American guests stay at the Best Western on Friday and Saturday night.  Experienced travelers are more than welcome to stay at any other area hotel.  For simplicity's sake, a bus will be provided to our American guests on the day of the wedding. It will drive from the Best Western to the ceremony & the venue.
