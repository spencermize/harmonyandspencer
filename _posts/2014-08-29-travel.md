###Airports###  
**Geneva Airport** is the closest international airport to Lyon and often the cheapest. You can catch a train to Lyon from Geneva.  

**Tip:** All trains that leave Geneva Airport stop in Geneva Central Station - **remember to buy tickets** at the automatic machines before stepping in the train! Additionally, Geneva uses Swiss Francs, *not* Euros. ATMs are available at the airport to pull out a few Francs to pay for transport.  

From the Geneva Central Station, you will need to buy tickets for *Lyon la Part Dieu*.  Don't worry - most Swiss rail employees speak English!  

**Paris Charles de Gaulle** is an alternative option, especially for those wishing to visit Paris.  
**To visit Paris:** You will take the RER B line to Chatelet-Les-Halles (downtown stop).  
**To go directly to Lyon** you can catch a train to *Lyon la Part Dieu* directly from the airport!
